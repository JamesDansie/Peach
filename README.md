# Peach
This project is a django server that will make an html page and an image for chosen dishes. 
Users can click an image to see the detail page. From the detail page they can vote for the 
dish or save an image of it.

For the initial setup; go to the root folder and type in the shell; 
1. This is for making the database ```python manage.py migrate```
2. This is for making an admin log in ```python manage.py createsuperuser```
3. To run the server ```python manage.py runserver```

To add more dishes or modify existing dishes, log in with an admin at /admin
